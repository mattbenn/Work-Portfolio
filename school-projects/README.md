which involved compiling information froma variety of sources (<a href="https://www.onetonline.org/">O-Net online</a>, interviews, surveys, and my own experience) and conducting
an anlysis of job-relevant knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) relevant to the job title of peer tutor. The report was the final deliverable.

<b>Assessment Validation Report:</b> This validation report was completed during a practicum. I worked with a team of other students complete the project for a company offering talent
assessment instruments. We were tasked with analyzing performance and assessment data from a real-estate firm to see whether the company's instrument successfully predicted performance.
I was involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, every part of the project, including data cleaning, preliminary analysis, correlational and regression analyses, and final
report writeup. FINISH THIS LATER
