I completed a job analysis for peer tutors, which involved compiling information froma variety of sources (<a href="https://www.onetonline.org/">O-Net online</a>, interviews, surveys, and my own experience) and conductingan anlysis of job-relevant knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) relevant to the job title of peer tutor. The report was the final deliverable.

<b>Academic Articles:</b>

<b><a href="https://www.nationalwellbeingservice.org/volumes/volume-5-2021/volume-5-article-4/">Does trait mindfulness help working college students get more satisfaction? The mediating role of work meaning and work-to-school enrichment:</b></a> This is an article I co-authored with my undergraduate research advisor, with whom I continued to collaborate after graduation. (COVID made it hard to conduct research at my Master's institution, SUNY Albany, so I was grateful for the opportunity to continue research work with Dr. Laurel McNall.) For this study, which investigated the relationship that trait mindfulness has with the work and school roles of college students, I oversaw survey administration and conducted the analyses, conducting multiple serial mediation analyses on the data.

I was in charge of the literature review to catch up on recent developments within the field of work-family enrichment since the first article's publication 6 years earlier and edited the first artice to include new information.
